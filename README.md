# anmala.nu

Lets you:

- Create a sign-up form with configurable fields, similar to Google Form
- Optionally set price and number of seats
- Add Swish or Stripe payment to it
- Copy a code snippet to embed the form on your page, either as an iframe or
  through a button that opens it in a modal. Alternatively,
  one can direct visitors to a URL.
- See the list of applications

The target audience is small businesses or individuals who occasionally
want to sell a course or run an event, and charge money for it. They post such
forms to their Facebook page, or embed them in their website builders like Wix or
Wordpress.

It was coded in 2021, but is now defunct and made public in case employers
want to see what I'd been up to.

It's available at https://anmala.johan.li/.
